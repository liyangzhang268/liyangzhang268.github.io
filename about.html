			<p>Liyang Zhang is an architect and ceramicist of Chinese heritage, born in Osaka, Japan. After graduating from the School of Architecture in Waterloo, Canada, she relocated to New York, where she has resided since.
</p>

      <p>She is interested in ancient Chinese culture, drawing inspiration from its metaphorical and figurative traditions, as well as its history in porcelain. The fluidity of her approach blurs the lines between architecture and pottery, allowing her to draw inspiration from both disciplines without discerning boundaries in her creative process.</p>

      <p>She is guided by artistic experimentation with new concepts, techniques, and mediums, making her work resist easy classification. Her artistic foundation, however, remains grounded in the understanding of form, proportion, relationships, and light.</p>
